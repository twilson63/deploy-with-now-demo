# Deploy Demo with NowJS

This repo is used to provide a working example of how to deploy both yuor api and web applications to the cloud using now.

NowJS is a platform that pushes immutable deploys, each time you deploy with now, you create a new unique deploy and you do not overwrite the older deploy.
